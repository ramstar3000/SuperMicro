Estimate Fits Image: 
The number of frames to use to estimate the fits image. This can cause memory allocation issues 
if set too high and if it is too low

Tolerance:
The tolerance for the fitting (GPUfit) algorithm. The lower the tolerance the more accurate the fit will be

Sorting:
This is to choose if you want segmentation/sorting on all the cluster profiles at the end of the program once all the
images have been analysed. This is useful if you want to see the distribution of the cluster profiles

Max Iterations:
The maximum number of iterations for the fitting algorithm. 
The higher the number the more accurate the fit will be

Start:
The starting frame for the analysis, this is for discarding the first few frames
if they are not needed for the analysis

Stop:
The last frame for the analysis, this is for discarding the last few frames
if they are not needed for the analysis. If set to 0 then the program will discard no frames

Drift:
The drift correction method to use. The options are BEADS, RCC, DME, NONE.

Drift2:
This is an OPTIONAL parameter used for when beads is selected as the drift correction method
but no beads have been detected by the program.

Timebin:
This is for RCC and DME and is the timebin to use for the drift correction

Zoom:
This is for RCC and DME and is the zoom to use for the drift correction

Num Beads:
This is used for beads to specify the expected number of beads per stack

Bead Dist:
This is used for beads to specify the expected distance between beads

Drift Graphs:
This is used to specify if you want to see the drift graphs for the drift correction methods

roiRadius:
This is the radius of the roi in pixels, this is used for localisation precision

CameraPixelSize:
This is the pixel size of the camera in nm

SMPixelSize:
This is the pixel size of the SR image in nm?

cameraOffset, cameraEMGain, cameraQE, cameraConversionFactor:
These are all camera parameters used for the intensity calculation into photons

filenum:
This is the number of image files to be analysed

frames:
This is the number of frames per image FOV and well, if split into multiple files then this is the aggregate number of frames

max_sigma:
This is the maximum sigma for the filtering process

max_localisation_precision:
This is the maximum localisation precision for the filtering process

grouping_distance:
This is the grouping distance for the filtering process

thresholding_sigmas:
This is the thresholding sigmas for the gathering of initial localisations

clustering:
This is used to specify if you want to use clustering. default is true

reconstruction:
This is used to specify if you want to use reconstruction. default is true

grouping:
This is used to specify if you want to use grouping. default is true
