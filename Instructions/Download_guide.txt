In order to run this software without having to install it, please donwload one of the distributions that have been listed and then you
will have a folder called `dist` in which you will find the executable file called `main.exe`. You can run this file and the program prompt will appear
and within this prompt you can link the directory to your images etc.


However, if you would like to download the python and run it from there, you can do so by downloading the `main.py` file, please clone the repository or download all the files 
within "" folder. Once you have done this, you can run the program by typing `python main.py` in your terminal

    To do this it is recommended that you set up a virtual environment and install the requirements.txt file. This can be done by typing the following commands in your terminal:

    Make your current directory the folder that you have downloaded the files to:
        cd "folder name"

    `pip install virtualenv` - This will install the virtual environment
    `virtualenv venv` - This will create a virtual environment called venv
    `venv\Scripts\activate` - This will activate the virtual environment
    `pip install -r Reqs/requirements.txt` - This will install all the requirements needed to run the program
    `pip install Reqs/pyGpufit-1.2.0-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl` - This will install the pyGpufit package

    Once you have done this you can run the program by typing `python main.py` in your terminal


    OR ALTENATIVELY using conda

    `conda create -n myenv python=3.11.2` - This will create a virtual environment called myenv
    `conda activate myenv` - This will activate the virtual environment
    `pip install -r Reqs/requirements.txt` - This will install all the requirements needed to run the program
    `pip install Reqs/pyGpufit-1.2.0-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl` - This will install the pyGpufit package

    Once you have done this you can run the program by typing `python main.py` in your terminal


Once this has been done to run the program again all you need to do is activate the virtual environment and run the program by typing `python main.py` in your terminal

Using virtualenv
    `venv\Scripts\activate` - This will activate the virtual environment
    `python main.py` - This will run the program

Using conda
    `conda activate myenv` - This will activate the virtual environment
    `python main.py` - This will run the program
